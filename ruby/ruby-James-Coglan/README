This app uses Ruby and Sinatra to provide a simple web service that remembers which
hashes have been tried, and farms the hashing out to JavaScript over the web. To
run it, first create two files in the same directory as app.rb:

    * found.txt -- leave this empty
    * current.txt -- should contain a decimal number between 0 and 2^32-1

The number in current.txt is the starting point.

This app is currently being hosted at http://kember.jcoglan.com
